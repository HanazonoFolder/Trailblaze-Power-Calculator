Plan in the future!
Making a UI

the most basic is TCP v1.1
the one with more features is TCP 2 v1.0 (but there's alot of issue on this one)

HSR TCP v1.0a is the main, it compose of TCP v1.1 and TCP 2 v1.0, its semi complete with one problem.

I'm returning on this project, with new tools and gui.
